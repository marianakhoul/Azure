# Blob Containers

Ultimate in the unstructured data. Container in which we can throw files. Give the container a name. 
There is also access levels. Private endpoint. 
Want to store images, text files and videos for a website - would use Blob containers.
Container level anonymous access allows you access to the whole container.
The default (private) is usually the best option.
Using the portal, we can upload data into the container.
Containers don't have a real folder structure, it's virtual folder structure. 
In the advanced option for the upload, can create a folder even if it doesn't exhist.
